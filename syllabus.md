### 2.What we can do with python(by now)

**There are some examples can be done with python, we can skip and revisit this section if want to learn the `GRAMMARS` first.**

* Organize files
* Excel
* PDF
* CSV & JSON(more attention)

#### Maybe some other topics
* Git & github

#### References

### 3.More about python language

**This section can be learned systematically, but can also learn when meet them in the wild.**

* Recursion
* Arguments of methods
* List/Set/Dict Comprehensions
* Generator & yield
* More OOPs
* Error handler
* RE

#### Maybe some other topics
* Github pages as CV

### 4.Python for scientific programming

#### Environment & setup
* Jupyter
* anaconda

#### Libs
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scipy

#### Advanced by very charming area <-> ML(Machine learning)

**This can be a whole semester class, however we can only learn to use the libs in a few hours if we don't care too much about the beneath mathematics.**

* scikit-learn [Won't go too depth]

#### Reference

[Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) Part 4

[Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/index.html)


### 5.1 Maybe more

By now, we should be able to do some real stuff with python and its amazing libs. Just like any programming language, there are surely some more depth topics to make things better. Just like matrix operations in matlab, scientific computing in python needs the libs we met at before.

To be honest, I can offer little help here, **practice makes perfect** is all I can tell.

However, some areas may be interesting for you if you can overcome some of the learning curve -- function programming in python, and maybe web programming, even the robots!


### 5.2 A little whisper

As you can see, I do list some reference links above, they are **all** pretty nice, **HOWEVER, we do not have to read them all before try to use python!!!**.

Python language is more human friendly compared with `C` or `C++`, if you just browse some codes in the `github`, great chances are that you actually can know what the author say if the file is not that large.

OOOkay, just some more links of **FREE** online books or tutorials if you don't know what to do to spend your spare time [-.-]:

* [PyQuick](http://pyquick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) maybe not so useful so far
* [A Byte of Python](https://www.gitbook.com/book/swaroopch/byte-of-python/details)
* [Beginner's Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide), there are just `TOO MANY` resources here, choose what you like


Aha, let's stop here, `python101` should just focus on the `101` part, we already go too far by now.
