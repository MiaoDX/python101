## Read & Write (txt-like) file

``` vi
# vi read_file_en.txt
It doesn't matter where you are,in the jungle or the desert or the moon.However lost you may feel,you'll never really be lost.Not really.Because I'll always be here.And I'll always come and find you.Every single time.
```



``` python
# Read from/write to a text file

# naive way
>> file = open('read_file.txt', 'r')
>> text = file.read()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
UnicodeDecodeError: 'gbk' codec can't decode byte 0xae in position 226: illegal multibyte sequence
```

By default, my PC will open file with `gbk` by default.

So just read ascii encoding is fine:

``` python
# vi read_with_encoding.py

>> file = open('read_file_ansi.txt', 'r', encoding='gbk') # specify encoding
# >> file = open('read_file_ansi.txt', 'r') # or omit the default encoding
>> text = file.read()
>> file.close()
```



``` python
# vi read_with_encoding.py

>> file = open('read_file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') # specify encoding
>> text = file.read()

>> file.close()
>> 
>> file2 = open('write_file.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8')
>> file2.write(text)
# 291
>> file2.close()
```

Detect encoding.

``` vi
pip install chardet
```

``` python
>>> import chardet
>>> file = open('read_file.txt', 'rb') # `rb` to make sure we can read
>>> first_line = file.readline()
>>> chardet.detect(first_line)
# {'encoding': 'UTF-8-SIG', 'confidence': 1.0}
>>> file.close()
>>> file = open('read_file_ansi.txt', 'rb')
>>> first_line = file.readline()
>>> chardet.detect(first_line)
{'encoding': 'ascii', 'confidence': 1.0}
>>> file.close()
```

`with` open -- especially when write to a new file.

`codecs.open`


All in one program:

## Read/Copy/Merge PDF

`PyPDF2`

Read content from pdf, extractText:

In fact, I encounter many pdfs which can not be read successfully.

[pdf_reader.py](automate_boring_stuff/pdf_reader.py)

Copy or merge pdfs:

[pdf_copy.py](automate_boring_stuff/pdf_copy.py)


### Encrypt

In fact I failed to encrypt the pdfs in a py file (encrypt is ok, but save to file takes unreasonably long), that said, do this on the console is ok.
