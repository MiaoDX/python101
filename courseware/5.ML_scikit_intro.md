# 5.ML_scikit_intro

Let have a glance at one of the hottest research and industrial field now -- ML (Machine learning) via the `scikit-learn` python library.

NOTE: MOST OF THE EXAMPLES AND CODES LISTS HERE ARE HEAVILY COPIED FROM SCIKIT OFFICIAL WEBSET.

## Conception

What's ML & what we can do with it?

## How much math is needed for us to use ML?

If just want to use the tech and get better than AVERAGE performance, you really do not need too much MATH.

If you want to extend some of the Algorithm to higher level, HUGH MATH and clever tricks are definitely needed. (Well, good luck)

## Environment Setup

* `pip` way
* `Anaconda` suite

I suggest to try and look at `scikit-learn` via `pip` way, once you want to do really stuff, install `Anadonda` to release yourself from the possible dependence problem.
