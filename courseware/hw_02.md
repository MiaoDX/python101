# List

* 1.Print out all elements in list (aka, iterate the list), via `for-in` without index

``` python
l1 = ['Good','Good','Study','Day','Day','Up']
```

* 2.Use index to get values from list.

``` python
L = [
    ['Apple', 'Google', 'Microsoft'],
    ['Java', 'Python', 'Ruby', 'PHP'],
    ['Adam', 'Bart', 'Lisa']
]

# print out `Apple`,`Python`,`Lisa`
```

* 3.Iterate the list in Q2

TIPS:

* 1.
``` python
for e in l1:
    print(e)
```

* 2.Multi-dimension array. `L[0][0]`
* 3.Just like Q1, use two `for-in`


# Dict

* 1.Count each char in a quote from 《Doctor Who》

``` vi
- "Times end, River, because they have to.
Because there's no such thing as happy ever after.
It's just a lie we tell ourselves because the truth is so hard."
- "No, Doctor, happy ever after doesn't mean forever,
It just mean time."
```

To quick check, just print out `n` and `N` is enough.

* 2.Count `Word` frequency in Q1's sentence


TIPS:

* 1.To get a multi-line string, use `"""THE VERY LONG SENTENCE"""`, see [hw/count.py](hw/count.py) for reference.

Use `for-in`, maybe `dict.setdefault()`

* 2.For `s = 'X X X'`
`s.split(' ')` and `s.split('X')` will get `['X', 'X', 'X']` and `['', ' ', ' ', '']` respectively. So just split the sentence first.

Maybe you will encounter `\n` in the answer, just `s.replace('\n', ' ')` to make it a space if you'd like.
