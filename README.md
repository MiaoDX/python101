## Python101 <-> Teaching python in 3*4 hours(3 hours per week, one month long)

I received the invitation to teach three `Non-programmers` to learn python, the time should be short, the fundamental things should be learned, necessary skills obtained in the classes can be useful for their graduated study overseas.

Well, this can be an interesting job and nice opportunity to review my knowledge about python, what's more, teaching is the best way to check whether we truly know a thing or not.

This repo contains the necessary materials/teaching notes/slides used in the classes and some other online tutorials and notes, since it's the every first time for me to teach a programming language systematically, chances are that the cources I provided can be subjective, maybe even with prejudice, but for `Python101` should be okay.

See the [syllabus](syllabus.md) to have a glance at what I want to discuss in this little classes.
