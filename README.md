## Python101 <-> Teaching python in 3*4 hours(3 hours per week, one month long)

I received the invitation to teach three `Non-programmers` to learn python, the time should be short, and they want to learn the fundamental things while hope to have necessary skills after the classes and can be useful for there graduated study overseas.

Well, this can be an interesting job and nice opportunity to review my knowledge about python, what's more, teaching is the best way to check whether we truly know a thing or not.

This repo contains the necessary materials used in the classes and some other online tutorials and notes.
